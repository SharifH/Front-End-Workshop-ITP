###What are these files
---
The files are broken up into folders based on the sessions that I hold. I recommend using GitHub to pull the repository so that you can easily pull the new files when I add more files.

In order to pull the repo first open terminal, and change directory
```
$ cd ..directory name
```

Next we will pull the repository using git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SharifH/Front-End-Workshop-ITP
```
Now just move into the new directory that we just pulled.

```
cd Front-End-Workshop-ITP
```

##Week 1 files
---
###HTML:CSS folder

This folder contains a boilerplate static site which you can use to create new pages. I have added some HTML and a little bit of styling just so that we can see what is happening. We also have jQuery's unminified file as well so that we can look at the file to see how jQuery works, but I have also added the minified cdn source that way you can have an optimized page(this means any changes made to the jQuery file will not register on your page unless you change the reference on the index page).
